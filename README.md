# Introduction

'TIDES' is a public data system containing the world largest ocean trash dataset, all collected by
volunteers. Filtered to U.S. data only, including variables such as zone, clean-up type, clean-up
date, pounds of trash, and all the different types of trash collected. The dataset includes 37,904
rows or records with 61 attributes.

We have used this dataset to perform exploratory analysis and build statistical models to find strong correlations between different variables we hypothesized might have a strong relation.

We have used this analysis to provide actionable Business insights for future sustainable development & Ocean clean up.
